# Docker-Escape
This project shows vulnerability how to escape from Docker container in which web application is running.

## About
This project is made for academic purposes during one of our courses at the AGH University of Krakow. <br /><br />
We present security issues in Docker. We show vulnerabilities of this software and best practices related to them. Below we also include case-studies showing how to get into the server from the user level of a web application, how to escape from this container and the possibilities that open up to us after such an escape.<br /><br />
